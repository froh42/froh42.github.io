title: PIDP-8
---

I found a really nice toy recently, someone hosts a [PDP-8/I on the internet](http://tss8.sdf.org) - and this is not really
an old PDP-8, it is a Raspberry Pi running an emulator with one of Oscar Vermeulen's
[PiDP-8](https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-8).

Damn. Now I need one too, for my living room ... I'm already registered for the next batch.
