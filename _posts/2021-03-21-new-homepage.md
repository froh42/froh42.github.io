Recently [Flo](http://florian.sesser.at/) and I met and revived the
[Workshop Softwarearchitektur](https://workshop-softwarearchitektur.de) web site and dokuwiki.

This (and some plans for the future) made me finally decide to get rid of the empty frohwalt.de homepage
and set up something where I can post content again.

So this is the result, it runs on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - so to update it, I just need to
write some markdown and push to github.
