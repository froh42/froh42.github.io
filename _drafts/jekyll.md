# Moving to github pages with jekyll

As I start to create a homepage again using github pages and [jekyll](jekyllrb.com) I'm in the
learning a lot of new stuff.

## Drafts

When I write drafts I don't mind them to be publically visible in the [github repo](https://github.com/froh42/froh42.github.io)
of this page, but I don't want them to be published right away. Ahaaa, jekyll can run with a [--drafts parameter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts)
